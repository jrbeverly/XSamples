File: XWindow.cpp
Sample: XWindow
Author: Jonathan Beverly
Description: Opens a single blank window using the XPlatformer framework.

Notes:
The XWindow sample makes use of the XInfo controller class.  The purpose of XInfo is to act as a controller
for handling a single xwindow.  It controls opening/closing/graphics and other aspects.  It removes a large 
portion of the busy work associated with XLib functions and as a wrapper.

The sample provided below is designed to show how to perform a series of basic tasks using the XGameLib library.

The following code is based on demo code provided in the CS349 course. The code has been altered to fit the XGameLib approach.

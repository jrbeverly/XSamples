# XSamples: XWindow

## Summary

The following is a sample that shows the basic process of opening a window using the helper files created for use in the XPlatformer project.  This sample is used for the purpose of showing how the `XInfo` class is used to control various XWindows commands.  XInfo acts as a wrapper for a variety of commonly used functions within XLib.   Additionally the sample can be used to test if XLib is properly installed, and that all XPlatformer code is properly compiling.

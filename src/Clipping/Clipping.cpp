File: Clipping.cpp
Sample: Clipping
Author: Jonathan Beverly
Description: Demos basic keyboard and mouse input systems.

Notes:
The XInput sample makes use of the KeyboardState and MouseState code to handle input.  These classes
are designed specifically as a foundation for XPlatformer.   This means that the keys specified in the
Keys.h file are limited to keys that are used in the XPlatformer game.   In addition, MouseState only
handles mouse position as mouse input was not needed in the application.

The XInput sample is designed to show how to perform a series of basic tasks using the XPlatformer framework
code.  However, it is important to note that a series of samples are based on concepts and ideas from
the CS349 Interfaces course.  Specifically, the idea of Text/Polyline are derived from an example
called "eventloop".   It is important to note that the course code only served as inspiration for the XPlatformer code.

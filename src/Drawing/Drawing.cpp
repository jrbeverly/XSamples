Sample: Drawing
Author: Jonathan Beverly
Description: Demos drawing functions and graphics contexts.

Notes:
The following is a sample that shows basic graphics usage using the helper files created for use in the XPlatformer project.
In this sample the `XInfo` is primarily used to perform common drawing functions.  `XInfo` wraps the various drawing functions
and automatically handles default management of textual and standard graphic contexts.  The sample specifically shows how to use
drawing commands, colour manipulation and line styles.

The Drawing sample is designed to show how to perform a series of basic tasks using the XPlatformer framework
code.  However, it is important to note that a series of samples are based on concepts and ideas from
the CS349 Interfaces course.  It is important to note that the code has been significantly changed from the original
source in order to use the XPlatformer code.
